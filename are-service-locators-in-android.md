This week, I've been playing with service locators in Android. I made [this](https://github.com/coroutineDispatcher/service_locator_demo) repo with 3 different branches. One of them is using Dagger as a DI tool, the other branches are implementation with KodeIn and Koin.  
  
The app is pretty simple, just retrieves some data from a Cat API, saves them to a local Room persistence and then renders them to the screen:

The screen renders just a the list of cats retrieved by the database after the data are fetched from a remote API. So let us list our dependencies:  
  
1 - First I'm using Retrofit, to fetch the data (and the interface which implements the server request methods)  
2- Second I need a database (I always use Room, but in my early beginning of Android development, I remember using Realm and it was awesome too)  
3- Since I'm using coroutines, I always keep a data class with coroutine dispatchers to be used in the ViewModel.  
4- The famous ViewModelFactory (for simplicity I'm not handling the savedStateHandle in this article)  
5-Â  Picasso, to render the images.  
  
I'm comparing theseÂ  tools in verbosity, simplicity and time to set up.  
  
## [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) 
Koin as a service locator is the easiest to get in with. The docs are pretty simple and it provides a lot of features, making it the perfect tool for Android in particular. However, it has some things I don't really like. Something I like to call the _pre-declaration of the constructor_. Notice this code here:  
  
```kotlin
val myModule = module{  
      ...  
      single {  
            CoroutineDispatchers(  
                Dispatchers.Main,  
                Dispatchers.IO  
            )  
        }  
  
        factory {  
            EntranceRepository(get(), get())  
        }  
  
        viewModel {  
            EntranceFragmentViewModel(get(), get())  
        }  
      ...  
    }
```

These lines are what I love and what I hate about Koin. First of all, I really love that it provides it's own feature about the ViewModel factory. But it has some perks, IMO:  
  
1- First of all when it comes to naming, if you think about it, one keyword is singleÂ (so it's a scope), and the other is a factory (doesn't give a message about the scope, but it's a factory), and the other is a viewmodel (definitely not a scope). This makes it a little bit chaotic, mixing the concept of scopes with factory patterns.  
  
2- The second thing is declaration of theÂ EntranceRepository(get(), get()) which is basically definition of a constructor. This is boilerplate IMO. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume it uses some kind of reflection (in which I don't know much), in order to invoke constructor in runtime. If you don't provide the EntranceRepository like that, you are most likely to break the app in runtime.  
  
_I'm not handling the part of field injection, because it looks the same in all DI tools. The constructor injection in Android is a little bit more tricky than the other parts._  
  
## [KodeIn](https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/) 
  
The same thing applies to KodeIn when it comes to speed of set up. It's fantastic. Furthermore, the lazy initialisation of dependencies looks really great to me.  
  
1- However, this is what I found suspicious in KodeIn [docs](https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/?6.5/android#_view_models):  
  
Â _Â To use Kodein, you need an Android context. For that, View Models need to implement AndroidViewModel._  
I'm pretty sure not many would agree to do that, and [here](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/locale-changes-and-the-androidviewmodel-antipattern-84eb677660d9) are some good reasons about it.  
  
Otherwise, you would need to keep your ViewModelFactory pattern, and KodeIn hasn't a pre-built feature for that, you have to do it manually. The pre declaration of constructor problem, does apply for KodeIn too.  
  
2- Another thing I noticed in KodeIn field injection, was the by kodein() delegation which does create a little bit of confusion because the kodein() method is a different extension method for Activities, Fragments etc.  
  
**My own idea of a service locator in Android:**  
Must note that this is only an idea and it's totally immature, but I find compile time safer than runtime. Therefore, annotations are perfectly solving a case of DI in the JVM world. If we forget Dagger for a moment, the next best example would be Spring framework with its' @Autowire injection keyword.  
Anyways, there could be library which could be a mix between Dagger and other service locators. I still imagine something like this:  
  
```kotlin
@Holder  
class MyApplication: Application(){  
   
  override fun onCreate(){  
   ..  
   MyApplicationHolder.init(this) //after compilation  
  }  
    
  @Single  
  fun provideDependency1() : Dependency1{  
    return Dependency1.builder().setItsThings(things).build()   
  }  
    
  @SomeScoped  
  fun provideDependency3(): Dependency3{  
    return Dependency3.builder().setItsThings3(things3).build()  
  }  
    
  @Single  
  @ByFactory  
  fun provideViewModel() : MyViewModel{  
    return MyViewModel(dependency1, dependency2)  
  }  
}  
  
@Single //which would be just a @Inject + @Singleton equivalent  
class Dependency2(){  
}  
  
//ViewModels  
  
@Single //A ViewModel factory would be generated for you by the "framework"  
class MyViewModel(d1: D1, d2: D2) : ViewModel(){  
    
}
```

This is far from explained or implemented, and I am still learning about code generation, but a Dagger without components would be awesome as a service locator (hopefully this is not Dagger1, because I've never seen it ðŸ˜…) .  
  
**Conclusion:**  
Using KodeIn or Koin in your codebase is pretty reasonable thing to do, if it solves your problem. But this article was more about to state that _they are not as simple as developer state_Â they are. Furthermore, I still think that Dagger takes a little more time to implement (and hopefully that's the hardest thing in Dagger, trust me) , but the generation of boilerplate comes from the framework and giving less work to the developer.
