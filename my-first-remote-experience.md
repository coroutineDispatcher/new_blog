I hope you get the joke....  
  
Well, it has been a very rough year for me, "motion-ally" and emotionally. I moved to Germany just when all these corona fear started. Luckily I got time to get introduced to the team and the project and got ready to start fresh . And then, since the situation with the epidemic wasn't getting any better, the company decided to switch to home office.  
  
**But how is it?**  
  
At [QuickBird](https://quickbirdstudios.com/) Studios, we had everything under control. They even posted a [blog post](https://quickbirdstudios.com/blog/remote-work-team-template/) themselves about the home office switch. However, I didn't want to provide guidelines more than I would like to share my own experience with remote work. Since it was my first time, I thought I should blog about it.  
  
**He who lives close to his school, is always late.**  
  
This Indian expression persecutes me on every step of my life. When I try to find a shortcut, I always end up on the longer way. What I mean is, nowadays that I am close to the computer, I get online at about 08:00 - 08:05 every day. While when I have to go to the office, I always end up at 07:40 - 07:50. And trust me, those 10 minutes on the morning are very important to open your eyes and realize what spaghetti you made one day before.  
  
**Empty the refrigerator**  
  
I lost control on food these last 2 years. Ever since I quit jogging, I gained 20 KG. But if you and your company are switching to remote work I wouldn't recommend to stay close to the fridge. Especially if you are a very lazy person for sports. Most importantly stay away from Snakes.....

**Politics > science**  
  
The title of this section could be a pretty nice click-bait. But my intention is to talk about communication. You have to be careful to be as kind as you are when you speak when you are talking to your colleges.  
  
**Enjoy the time off**  
  
I usually have a one hour break, and whatever the problem is, I really try not to think about work on my time off, even though the computer is two steps away from me.  
  
**Concentration > hard work**  
  
It's normal that you might get distracted a lot at home, especially when there are other people there too. But, if you get distracted it's better to have a short break than stare to the computer trying to understand Java's null.  
  
**We are software engineers**  
  
Well, what I mean is that normally, it should not matter that much. Home office or Office Office, as a software engineer the it's pretty easy, wherever you are. The conditions are nearly the same. Just get the work done....  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
With the eastern post-communist culture, I must say it: I am hell a lot of more disciplined when I get up, get the bus/train to work, work there for the required hours and than get back to enjoy some quality time with family, watch a TV show or whatever. However, all the things I mentioned above are truly what remote work has taught me. And it's only one week, no wonder how much I can learn more during all these time at home-office.
